<p>Have you always wanted to learn how to program but could never afford those ridiculously expensive courses?

    Developers and programmers are amongst the highest paid professions in the world, and according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of jobs for software and app developers will increase by a shocking 24% in the next few years.
    
    In 2019, the tech industry posted 4.6 million job openings in the US job market, and their direct economic output was estimated at 1.9 trillion dollars.
    
    There’s no doubt that the IT industry is the future, and software, web, and app developers are and will be the most coveted professionals for many years to come.
    
    But here’s the shock you may not have seen coming: the IT industry has a backdoor--you only need to know how to open it in order to jump straight on that cash wagon.
    
    The key to that door is JavaScript, a programming language that has withstood the test of time and has become one of the most used languages.</p>
